bc is a command-line, arbitrary-precision calculator with a Turing-complete
language. See the GNU bc manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/bc.html)
and bc spec (http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html)
for details.

This bc has three differences to the GNU bc:

  1) The period (.) can also be used as a shortcut for "last", as in the BSD bc.
  2) Arrays are copied before being passed as arguments to functions. This
     behavior is required by the bc spec.
  3) Arrays can be passed to the builtin "length" function to get the number of
     elements currently in the array. The following example prints "1":

       a[0] = 0
       length(a[])

Options:

  -h  --help         print this usage message and exit
  -i  --interactive  force interactive mode
  -l  --mathlib      use predefined math routines:

                       s(expr)  =  sine of expr in radians
                       c(expr)  =  cosine of expr in radians
                       a(expr)  =  arctangent of expr, returning radians
                       l(expr)  =  natural log of expr
                       e(expr)  =  raises e to the power of expr
                       j(n, x)  =  Bessel function of integer order n of x

  -q  --quiet        don't print version and copyright
  -s  --standard     error if any non-POSIX extensions are used
  -w  --warn         warn if any non-POSIX extensions are used
  -v  --version      print version information and copyright and exit
