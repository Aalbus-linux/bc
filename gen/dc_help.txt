dc is a reverse-polish notation command-line calculator which supports unlimited
precision arithmetic. See the FreeBSD man page
(https://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/1/dc/) and GNU dc manual
(https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/dc-1.05/html_mono/dc.html) for details.

This dc has a few differences from the two above:

  1) When printing a byte stream (command "P"), this bc follows what the FreeBSD
     dc does.
  2) This dc implements the GNU extensions for divmod ("~") and modular
     exponentiation ("|").
  3) This dc implements all FreeBSD extensions, except for "J" and "M".
  4) Like the FreeBSD dc, this dc supports extended registers. However, it is
     implemented differently. When it encounters whitespace where a register
     should be, it skips the whitespace. If the character following is not
     a lowercase letter, an error is issued. Otherwise, the register name is
     parsed by the following regex:

       [a-z][a-z0-9_]*

     This generally means that register names will be surrounded by parentheses.

     Examples:

       l idx s temp L index S temp2 < do_thing

     Also note that, like the FreeBSD dc, extended registers are not allowed
     unless the "-x" option is given.

Options:

  -e expr  --expression=expr  run "expr" and quit. If multiple expressions or
                              files (see below) are given, they are all run.
  -f  file  --file=file       run the bc code in "file" and exit. See above.
  -h  --help                  print this usage message and exit.
  -V  --version               print version and copyright and exit.
  -x  --extended-register     enable extended register mode.
